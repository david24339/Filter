Have you ever wondered what happens when you apply a filter on an image? if so, this program gives an answer. Filter is a Python program that apply a grayscale or sierra filter on a .gif image provided by the user. First of all, the user is prompted for the name of an image,which should be in the same directory as filter.py. Then, the program goes through each pixel changing the RGB values to have the effect of a grayscale or sierra filter. Finally, the program saves a copy of the filtered image in the same directory.
